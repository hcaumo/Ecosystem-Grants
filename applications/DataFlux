## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

**Tagline:** Decentralized platform for tokenizing, anonymizing, and monetizing financial data via tokenization on Polkadot.

We are building the first decentralized marketplace for tokenizing and trading anonymized financial data from Open Finance. Integrated with Pluggy.ai and Pop Network (Polkadot parachain), our solution leverages ink! smart contracts to ensure privacy, user control, and  stablecoin payments.


**Relation to ink! ecosystem:** Native use of ink! smart contracts for data tokenization, marketplace logic.

**Category:** Infrastructure — Enabling decentralized financial data monetization.

**Why this project:** To revolutionize data ownership, offering users privacy-preserving monetization while providing companies with access to high-quality datasets.

### Ink! Ecosystem Impact

Our project strengthens the ink! ecosystem by delivering a practical infrastructure for decentralized data trading. It showcases ink!'s capabilities in handling sensitive financial data through privacy-first smart contracts, fostering adoption among fintechs and institutional players.

This infrastructure can be expanded by other developers to tokenize different data types, promoting interoperability and further use of ink! in real-world applications.

### Project Details

- **Data Models / API Specs:** Integration with Pluggy.ai API for financial data ingestion; internal APIs for tokenization and marketplace interactions.
- **Tech Stack:** React.js, Supabase, Typescript (Node.js), PostgreSQL, ink! smart contracts on Polkadot (Pop Network), Pluggy.ai integration.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive technical documentation and partner onboarding materials.
- **PoC/MVP:** Delivered within 10 weeks.
- **Limitations:** The platform will not store personal data on-chain. We will not develop custom stablecoins—only USDC/USDT integrations.
- **Audit Needed:** YES
- **CATEGORY:** Infrastructure
- **Business Model:** B2C2B marketplace. Revenue via transaction fees on data sales.
- **Future Plans:** Expansion to other data types (e.g., health data), partnerships with global fintechs.
